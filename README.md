A WIP program to solve battleship solitaire puzzles and assign them a difficulty level.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(puzzle) for a description and rules for these puzzles.

The goal of this program is to eventually be able to generate battleship solitaire puzzles of a specified difficulty level. This could be accomplished either by:
  1) Randomly generating puzzles and solving them until one with the correct difficulty level is found
  2) Taking a completed puzzle and applying the same rules that could be used to solve a puzzle of the specified difficulty in reverse to remove tiles until the
     puzzle is mostly blank
     
I'm using a book of 180 puzzles split into 6 difficulties as the basis for the difficulty scoring. I can't upload these puzzles due to copyright, but have included a short list of free battleship puzzles found online instead.
